# Student-Planner

The Student Planner System aims to help students organize their schedules, assignments, and deadlines effectively. By integrating Firebase for database management, the system provides real-time updates and reliable data storage. As a Frontend Developer, I focused on creating a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and appealing design, making it easier for students to manage their academic responsibilities efficiently and stay organized.
